      <!--What is Meditation-->
      <li><p><em><h3>What is Meditation?</h3></em></p></li>
      <p style = "color:red;">Meditation is a word which has been defined and interpreted 
        in countless different ways, from reflecting deeply on a subject
        to sitting quietly with closed eyes and focused attention.</p>
        
      <!--What is Sahajayoga Meditation-->
        <li><p><em><h3>What is Sahajayoga Meditation?</h3></em><p></li>
          <li><b><em>Meditation in Sahaja Yoga is based on self-realization</em></b>, where the subtle 
                          inner energy of the practitioner is awakened, 
                          leading to a state known as "thoughtless awareness."
                          This thoughtless awareness, or meditation, 
                          occurs when the mind is not disturbed by thoughts,
                          yet remains perfectly aware.</p></li>
          <li><p> Self-realization is the foundation of Sahaja yoga. 
              <em><b>It is based on an experience called the “Kundalini awakening,”</b></em> 
                     which can occur within all human beings. </p></li>
  <!-- <b> tag is used to bold the text>
    <!--What is Kundlini-->
        <li><p><em><h3>What is Kundlini?</h3></em></p></li>
          <p style="color:red;">Kundalini is the power of pure desire within us, a motherly and 
             soothing spiritual energy which lies dormant at the base of the 
             spine in the <b><em>sacrum bone</em></b> (the ancient civilizations knew that in this bone resides a sacred energy).</p>
 
  <!-- Lets Understand the subtle system.-->
        <li><p><em><h3>Let's Understand Our subtle system.</h3></em></p></li>
  <center><img src="https://www.sahajayoga.org.in/images/kundalini.png" alt="Our Subtle System Diagram"></center>
  <p><center>The subtle system is made up of nadis and chakras. Nadis, or channels, carry energy throughout the body while chakras, or “wheels,” are the centers of energy located in the body. 
    There are three primary vertical channels of energy and seven major chakras. This system can only be activated with a Kundalini awakening. 
    The Kundalini awakening simultaneously cleans and balances the system and enlightens and purifies the chakras.</center></p>
